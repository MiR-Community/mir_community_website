# Be a presenter for the MiR 2022 Fall Webinar Series!
Are you interested in sharing your knowledge and your work to the MiR Community and beyond? We are looking for three speakers to kick off our MiR Fall 2022 Webinar Series! Topics include, but are not limited to: professional development(i.e. writing a resume, interview tips), sharing how to do a specific task using R (i.e. data scrubbing, text analysis, data visualization), or sharing a project or package you have created. Please check the [MiR Community YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdDHw9NNMznBjZ4SOaMwjQ) to see past presentations.

# Presentation Requirements
The presentation must be between one to two hours long and preference will be given to current MiR members. Selected presenters will be compensated $100 or the equivalent and will also receive some MiR swag! We will provide ASL interpretation and live captioning for each webinar. Anyone who is interested can fill out this [application](https://forms.gle/cf8peSs53np45e8X7) by May 31st to be considered. Selected presenters will be notified on June 30th. Applicants must agree to follow the MiR Accessibility Policy and Code of Conduct if they are selected to present in the webinar series and have their webinar ready two weeks before the date of the webinar for an accessibility. Selected participants will be given the MiR Accessibility Guidebook and Code of Conduct to aid them in making their presentations accessible. If you have any questions, please send us an [e-mail](mailto:team@mircommunity)!
