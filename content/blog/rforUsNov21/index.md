![](kerrit_profile.png “image of Kerritt Saintal, winner of R for the Rest of Us Scholarship”))  
In September,  R for the Rest of Us, an organization that provides training and consulting in R,  invited MiR members to apply to receive a full scholarship worth $899 to participate in the R in 3 Months program. With the R in 3 Months program, participants go through Getting Started with R, Fundamentals of R, Going Deeper with R, and lessons on using Git and GitHub. This scholarship was targeted for those who are novices in R and are interested in becoming more proficient in the language. We are proud to announce that Kerritt Saintal is the winner of the scholarship!


Kerritt Saintal, who is originally from New Orleans, currently lives in the DMV (Washington D.C.-Maryland-Virginia) area and is pursuing her MPH in Epidemiology at the Eastern Virginia Medical School and receiving this scholarship will allow her to pursue her long term professional goals career-wise and give her the ability to create data tools, resources, and opportunities for underserved and underrepresented minority populations.

We wish Kerritt the best of luck in her R learning journey!
